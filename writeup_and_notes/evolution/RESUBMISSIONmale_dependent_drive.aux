Alleles at these two tightly linked loci form three haplotypes (top of A). {\bf  {A1)}} In the standard model of drive there is no variation at the modifier, and the driver is transmitted to the egg with probability $d_0$. {\bf  {A2)}} The modifier allele increases the transmission of the drive allele ($d_1 > d_0$), and due to their shared genetic background, also increases its drive. {\bf  {A3 \& A4)}} The sperm-acting modifier acts to decrease drive ($d_1=1/2$ in A3 \& A4, or more generally, $d_1 < d_0$) and arises on the same or opposite background from the driver (A3 \& A4 respectively). {\bf  {(B)}} Invasion of a sperm-acting drive suppressor linked to a driver. After the driver ($B$ haplotype) reaches drive selection equilibrium, we introduce a sperm acting drive modifier. We assume full drive ($D_0 =1$), a recessive lethal fitness cost to drive ($h_s=0$, $s=1$) and that the sperm-acting modifier results in a fair meiosis. {\bf  {B1)}} The $B^-$ allele replaces the ancestral drive haplotype, but segregates at a lower equilibrium frequency. {\bf  {B2)}} The $A^-$ allele replaces the ancestral non-driving haplotype, and in this case, removes the driver from the population. }}{25}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S3}{\ignorespaces Exact results of invasion analysis of an allele whose effect on female meiosis is mediated by the genotype of the fertilizing male. A heterozygous female transmits the $B$ allele with probabilities $\frac  {1}{2}$, $d_{het}=\frac  {1}{2} + h(d_{hom}-\frac  {1}{2}) $ or $d_{hom}$, if she mated with a n $AA$, $AB$, or $BB$ male, respectively. The allele suffers a recessive fitness cost $s$. The four panels correspond to different dominance relationships. In the parameter space below the invasion (solid) line the self-promoter driver can invade. In the parameter space below the fixation (long dash) line the self-promoter can fix. In the last two panels the invasion line is above the fixation line and so the allele can be maintained as a polymorphism in that thin slice of parameter space between the two lines. In the final panel we show the fixation line (small dashes) as predicted by our HWE approximation ($(d_{het}-1/2)/d_{het}$) see the appendix for more details. }}{28}}
