	Abstract = {Centromeres mediate the faithful segregation of eukaryotic chromosomes. Yet they display a remarkable range in size and complexity across eukaryotes, from approximately 125 bp in budding yeast to megabases of repetitive satellites in human chromosomes. Mapping the fine-scale structure of complex centromeres has proven to be daunting, but recent studies have provided a first glimpse into this unexplored bastion of our genomes and the evolutionary pressures that shape it. Evolutionary studies of proteins that bind centromeric DNA suggest genetic conflict as the underlying basis of centromere complexity, drawing interesting parallels with the myriad selfish elements that employ centromeric activity for their own survival.},

@article{Haig2010,
	Abstract = {The two alleles at a heterozygous locus segregate during meiosis, sometimes at meiosis I and sometimes at meiosis II. The timing of segregation is determined by the pattern of crossing-over between a locus and its attached centromeres. Genes near centromeres can exploit this process by driving against spores from which the genes separated at meiosis I. Other genes, located distal to centromeres, can benefit from driving against spores from which they separated at meiosis II. Asymmetric female meiosis is particularly susceptible to such forms of drive. Selection on modifiers of recombination favors changes in the location of chiasmata that increase the proportion of tetrads of high average fitness by changing the timing of segregation. Such changes increase the frequency of driving alleles. This source of selection on recombination does not depend on effects on linkage disequilibrium. Recombinational responses to meiotic drive may contribute to sex differences in overall recombination and sex differences in the localization of chiasmata.},

@article{Brandvain2012,
	Abstract = {Theories to explain the prevalence of sex and recombination have long been a central theme of evolutionary biology. Yet despite decades of attention dedicated to the evolution of sex and recombination, the widespread pattern of sex differences in the recombination rate is not well understood and has received relatively little theoretical attention. Here, we argue that female meiotic drivers--alleles that increase in frequency by exploiting the asymmetric cell division of oogenesis--present a potent selective pressure favoring the modification of the female recombination rate. Because recombination plays a central role in shaping patterns of variation within and among dyads, modifiers of the female recombination rate can function as potent suppressors or enhancers of female meiotic drive. We show that when female recombination modifiers are unlinked to female drivers, recombination modifiers that suppress harmful female drive can spread. By contrast, a recombination modifier tightly linked to a driver can increase in frequency by enhancing female drive. Our results predict that rapidly evolving female recombination rates, particularly around centromeres, should be a common outcome of meiotic drive. We discuss how selection to modify the efficacy of meiotic drive may contribute to commonly observed patterns of sex differences in recombination.},

@article{Mira1998,
	Abstract = {In mammals and birds, females are born with all the oocytes required for future ovulations. These oocytes are not haploid: they are arrested at the Prophase I of meiosis when they have two sister chromatids of each chromosome (i.e. the eggs are at the 4C stage). Under the assumption that the low number of ovulated eggs in these species have been selected to be of high quality, I propose three explanations for these two observations: (I) producing the eggs before birth may decrease the variance in mutations and genetic damage, thereby reducing risk; (II) arresting the oocytes at a 4C stage may allow sister-strand recombination to repair genetic damage; (III) arresting the oocytes at the 4C stage may mitigate intergametic conflict, hence potential selection of the oocytes for ovulation will not involve conflict. Predictions from the Mutational, Repair, and Conflict Hypotheses are critically evaluated in the light of unpublished data, evolutionary theory, and computer simulations.},

The inheritance of chromosome 1 with two insertions from the Yakutsk population is analysed in this paper. It was demonstrated that heterozygous females transmit this chromosome to 80-85% of offspring. The observations made at M II, in conjunction with the recombination data, allowed us to conclude that preferential passage of the chromosome 1 with insertions to the oocyte and egg, rather than to the first and second polar bodies at meiosis, is the causative factor of the distorted segregation. A meiotic drive of such potency has not been previously reported for female mammals. The possible mechanism of the drive is discussed.},

The specific features of the aberrant chromosome have been described elsewhere (Agulnik et al. 1990). These include its preferential entry into the oocyte of heterozygous females, increased mortality of homozygotes and decreased fertility of homozygous females. Here we present data indicating that chromatid segregation in heterozygous females depends upon which sperm enters the oocyte before the second meiotic division: meiotic drive is powerful when it is sperm bearing normal chromosome 1, and segregation normalizes during MII when it is sperm bearing chromosome 1 with the extra segment. Experimental data are adduced and explanations offered for the observed phenomenon.},

@article{Hurst1996,
	Abstract = {Self-promoting elements (also called ultraselfish genes, selfish genes, or selfish genetic elements) are vertically transmitted genetic entities that manipulate their ''host'' so as to promote their own spread, usually at a cost to other genes within the genome. Examples of such elements include meiotic drive genes and cytoplasmic sex ratio distorters. The spread of a self-promoting element creates the context for the spread of a suppressor acting within the same genome. We may thus say that a genetic conflict exists between different components of the same genome. Here we investigate the properties of such conflicts. First we consider the potential diversity of genomic conflicts and show that every genetic system has potential conflicts. This is followed by analysis of the logic of conflicts. Just as Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) terminology provides a short cut for discussion of much in behavioral ecology, so the language of modifier analysis provides a useful terminology on which to base discussions of conflicts. After defining genetic conflict, we provide a general analysis of the conflicting parties, and note a distinction between competing and conflicting genes. We then provide a taxonomy of possible short- and long-term outcomes of conflicts, noting that potential conflict in an unconstrained system can never be removed, and that the course of evolution owing to conflict is often unpredictable. The latter is most particularly true for strong conflicts in which suppressors may take surprising forms. The possibility of extended conflicts in the form of ''arms races'' between element and suppressor is illustrated. The peculiar redundancy of these systems is one possible trace of conflict, and others are discussed. That homologous conflicts may find highly different expression is discussed by referring to the mechanistic differences that are thought to underlie the action of the two best-described meiotic drive genes, and by the multiplicity of forms of cytoplasmic sex ratio distorters. The theoretical analysis establishes a logical basis for thinking about conflicts, but fails to establish the importance of conflict in evolution. We illustrate this contentious issue through consideration of some phenomena for whose evolution conflict has been proposed as an important force: the evolution of sex, sex determination, species, recombination, and uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genes. In general, it is proposed that conflict may be a central force in the evolution of genetic systems. We conclude that an analysis of conflict and its general importance in evolution is greatly aided by application of the concept of genetic power. We consider the possible components of genetic power and ask whether and how power evolves.},

@article{Crow1991,
	Abstract = {The precise 1:1 segregation of Mendelian heredity is ordinarily taken for granted, yet there are numerous examples of 'cheating' genes that perpetuate themselves in the population by biasing the Mendelian process in their favor. One example is the Segregation Distortion system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which the distorting gene causes its homologous chromosome to produce a nonfunctional sperm. This system depends on three closely linked components, whose molecular basis is beginning to be understood. The system is characterized by numerous modifiers changing the degree of distortion. Mathematical theory shows that unlinked modifiers that change the degree of distortion in the direction of Mendelism always increase in the population. This provides a mechanism for removing cheaters and preserving the honesty of the Mendelian gene-shuffle.},

	Abstract = {Segregation Distorter (SD) is a selfish, coadapted gene complex on chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster that strongly distorts Mendelian transmission; heterozygous SD/SD + males sire almost exclusively SD-bearing progeny. Fifty years of genetic, molecular, and theory work have made SD one of the best-characterized meiotic drive systems, but surprisingly the details of its evolutionary origins and population dynamics remain unclear. Earlier analyses suggested that the SD system arose recently in the Mediterranean basin and then spread to a low, stable equilibrium frequency (15\%) in most natural populations worldwide. In this report, we show, first, that SD chromosomes occur in populations in sub-Saharan Africa, the ancestral range of D. melanogaster, at a similarly low frequency (2\%), providing evidence for the robustness of its equilibrium frequency but raising doubts about the Mediterranean-origins hypothesis. Second, our genetic analyses reveal two kinds of SD chromosomes in Africa: inversion-free SD chromosomes with little or no transmission advantage; and an African-endemic inversion-bearing SD chromosome, SD-Mal, with a perfect transmission advantage. Third, our population genetic analyses show that SD-Mal chromosomes swept across the African continent very recently, causing linkage disequilibrium and an absence of variability over 39\% of the length of the second chromosome. Thus, despite a seemingly stable equilibrium frequency, SD chromosomes continue to evolve, to compete with one another, or evade suppressors in the genome.},

@article{Malik2001,
	Abstract = {Centromeric DNA is generally composed of large blocks of tandem satellite repeats that change rapidly due to loss of old arrays and expansion of new repeat classes. This extreme heterogeneity of centromeric DNA is difficult to reconcile with the conservation of the eukaryotic chromosome segregation machinery. Histone H3-like proteins, including Cid in Drosophila melanogaster, are a unique chromatin component of centromeres. In comparisons between closely related species of Drosophila, we find an excess of replacement changes that have been fixed since the separation of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, suggesting adaptive evolution. The last adaptive changes appear to have occurred recently, as evident from a reduction in polymorphism in the melanogaster lineage. Adaptive evolution has occurred both in the long N-terminal tail as well as in the histone fold of Cid. In the histone fold, the replacement changes have occurred in the region proposed to mediate binding to DNA. We propose that this rapid evolution of Cid is driven by a response to the changing satellite repeats at centromeres. Thus, centromeric H3-like proteins may act as adaptors between evolutionarily labile centromeric DNA and the conserved kinetochore machinery.},

@article{Hiatt2003,
	Abstract = {We provide a genetic analysis of the meiotic drive system on maize abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10) that causes preferential segregation of specific chromosomal regions to the reproductive megaspore. The data indicate that at least four chromosomal regions contribute to meiotic drive, each providing distinct functions that can be differentiated from each other genetically and/or phenotypically. Previous reports established that meiotic drive requires neocentromere activity at specific tandem repeat arrays (knobs) and that two regions on Ab10 are involved in trans-activating neocentromeres. Here we confirm and extend data suggesting that only one of the neocentromere-activating regions is sufficient to move many knobs. We also confirm the localization of a locus/loci on Ab10, thought to be a prerequisite for meiotic drive, which promotes recombination in structural heterozygotes. In addition, we identified two new and independent functions required for meiotic drive. One was identified through the characterization of a deletion derivative of Ab10 Df(L) and another as a newly identified meiotic drive mutation (suppressor of meiotic drive 3). In the absence of either function, meiotic drive is abolished but neocentromere activity and the recombination effect typical of Ab10 are unaffected. These results demonstrate that neocentromere activity and increased recombination are not the only events required for meiotic drive.},

@article{Buckler1999,
	Abstract = {Meiotic drive is the subversion of meiosis so that particular genes are preferentially transmitted to the progeny. Meiotic drive generally causes the preferential segregation of small regions of the genome; however, in maize we propose that meiotic drive is responsible for the evolution of large repetitive DNA arrays on all chromosomes. A maize meiotic drive locus found on an uncommon form of chromosome 10 abnormal 10 (Ab10) may be largely responsible for the evolution of heterochromatic chromosomal knobs, which can confer meiotic drive potential to every maize chromosome. Simulations were used to illustrate the dynamics of this meiotic drive model and suggest knobs might be deleterious in the absence of Ab10. Chromosomal knob data from maize's wild relatives (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and mexicana) and phylogenetic comparisons demonstrated that the evolution of knob size, frequency, and chromosomal position agreed with the meiotic drive hypothesis. Knob chromosomal position was incompatible with the hypothesis that knob repetitive DNA is neutral or slightly deleterious to the genome. We also show that environmental factors and transposition may play a role in the evolution of knobs. Because knobs occur at multiple locations on all maize chromosomes, the combined effects of meiotic drive and genetic linkage may have reshaped genetic diversity throughout the maize genome in response to the presence of Ab10. Meiotic drive may be a major force of genome evolution, allowing revolutionary changes in genome structure and diversity over short evolutionary periods.},

Although significant lethality occurs in this backcross (50\%), differences in the level of TRD found in recombinant vs. nonrecombinant chromosomes among offspring argue that TRD is due to nonrandom segregation of chromatids at the second meiotic division, i.e., true meiotic drive. We tested this hypothesis directly, by determining the centromere and Om genotypes of individual chromatids in zygote stage embryos. We found similar levels of TRD in favor of DDK alleles at Om in the female pronucleus and TRD in favor of C57BL/6 alleles at Om in the second polar body. In those embryos for which complete dyads have been reconstructed, TRD was present only in those inheriting heteromorphic dyads. These results demonstrate that meiotic drive occurs at MII and that preferential death of one genotypic class of embryo does not play a large role in the TRD.},

	Abstract = {We show here that recombination occurs at the normal rate in compound female mice containing two different complementing lethal haplotypes (th17/tw12) where there is a long stretch of homologous t-mutant chromatin. Thus the recombination suppression of a complete t-haplotype cannot be due to an intrinsic factor(s) which suppresses along the length of its own chromosome but is due to 'mismatching' of wild-type and mutant chromatin. Naturally occurring t-haplotypes of mouse chromosome 17 have several interesting genetic properties. First, they are always transmitted from males in much higher proportions than mendelian expectation; presumably this accounts for the maintenance of lethal and semilethal t-haplotypes at polymorphic levels in populations of wild mice. t-Haplotypes also show recombination suppression. The conventional map distance between genetic markers T and tf is 7-12 cM, whereas in (t/+) heterozygotes for naturally occurring t-haplotypes, recombination is suppressed and T and tf seem to be separated by only 0.1-0.5 cM (ref. 1). The region of recombination suppression extends to and includes the major histocompatibility complex (H-2). Thus t and H-2 effectively travel as a single unit- a 'super gene'. Although recombination suppression is known to be accompanied by failure of chiasmata formation, the mechanism underlying the suppression has remained an enigma. Lyon suggested a disorder of t-heterochromatin and more recently a change in 'intercalary' middle repetitive DNA. She proposed that either t-chromatin is intrinsically incapable of participating in crossing-over, or chiasma formation is prevented because of mismatching and mispairing of normal and abnormal chromatin. We have measured recombinant between two chromosomes which carried extensive overlapping segments of t-chromatin. We report here that in this configuration, recombination occurs at a normal rate, and thus we conclude that cross-over suppression is due to mismatching.},

	Abstract = {The meiotic drive system on maize abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab10) is contained within a terminal domain of chromatin that extends the long arm of Ab10 to 1.3 times the size of normal chromosome 10L. Ab10 type I (Ab10-I) does not recombine with normal chromosome 10 (N10) over an 32-cM terminal region of the long arm. Comparative RFLP mapping demonstrates that multiple independent rearrangements are responsible for the current organization of Ab10-I, including a set of nested inversions and at least one long supernumerary segment at the end of the chromosome. Four major meiotic drive functions, i.e., the recombination effect, smd3, 180-bp neocentromere activity, and the distal tip function, all map to the distal supernumerary segment. TR-1-mediated neocentromere activity (the fifth known drive function) is nonessential in the type II variant of Ab10 and maps to a central region that may include a second supernumerary insertion. Both neocentromere activity and the recombination effect behave as dominant gain-of-function mutations, consistent with the view that meiotic drive involves new or alien gene products. These and other data suggest that the Ab10 meiotic drive system was initially acquired from a related species and that a complex haplotype evolved around it.},

The models incorporate the general features of the Sd and Rsp loci which form the core of the SD system. It is shown that the SD polymorphism can be established only when there is sufficiently tight linkage between Sd and Rsp. An approximate treatment, valid for tight linkage, is given of all the equilibria of the system and their stabilities. It is shown that the observed composition of natural and artificial populations with respect to the Sd and Rsp loci is predicted well by the model, provided that restrictions are imposed on the fertilities of certain genotypes. Highly oscillatory paths towards equilibrium are usually to be expected on the basis of this model. The selection pressures on inversions introduced into this system are also investigated.},

We have previously documented the adaptive evolution of the Drosophila CenH3 (Cid) in comparisons of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, a divergence of approximately 2.5 million years. We have proposed that rapidly changing centromeric DNA may be driving CenH3's altered DNA-binding specificity. Here, we compare Cid sequences from a phylogenetically broader group of Drosophila species to suggest that Cid has been evolving adaptively for at least 25 million years. Our analysis also reveals conserved blocks not only in the histone-fold domain but also in the N-terminal tail. In several lineages, the N-terminal tail of Cid is characterized by subgroup-specific oligopeptide expansions. These expansions resemble minor groove DNA binding motifs found in various histone tails. Remarkably, similar oligopeptides are also found in N-terminal tails of human and mouse CenH3 (Cenp-A). The recurrent evolution of these motifs in CenH3 suggests a packaging function for the N-terminal tail, which results in a unique chromatin organization at the primary constriction, the cytological marker of centromeres.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery, mapping, and characterization of a meiotic drive locus (D) exhibiting nearly 100\% nonrandom transmission in hybrids between two species of yellow monkeyflowers, outcrossing Mimulus guttatus and selfing M. nasutus. Only 1\% of F2 hybrids were M. nasutus homozygotes at the marker most tightly linked to D. We used a set of reciprocal backcrosses to distinguish among male-specific, female-specific, and zygote-specific sources of transmission ratio distortion. Transmission was severely distorted only when the heterozygous F1 acted as the female parent in crosses to either parental species, ruling out pollen competition and zygote mortality as potential sources of drive. After four generations of backcrossing to M. nasutus, nearly isogenic lines were still >90\% heterozygous at markers linked to D, suggesting that heterozygosity at the drive locus alone is sufficient for nonrandom transmission. A lack of dramatic female fitness costs in these lines rules out alternatives involving ovule or seed mortality and points to a truly meiotic mechanism of drive. The strength and direction of drive in this system is consistent with population genetic theory of selfish element evolution under different mating systems. These results are the first empirical demonstration of the strong female-specific drive predicted by new models of selfish centromere turnover.},

	Abstract = {Most geneticists assume that chromosome segregation during meiosis is Mendelian (i.e., each allele at each locus is represented equally in the gametes). The great majority of reports that discuss non-Mendelian transmission have focused on systems of gametic selection, such as the mouse t-haplotype and Segregation distorter in Drosophila, or on systems in which post-fertilization selection takes place. Because the segregation of chromosomes in such systems is Mendelian and unequal representation of alleles among offspring is achieved through gamete dysfunction or embryonic death, there is a common perception that true disturbances in the randomness of chromosome segregation are rare and of limited biological significance. In this review we summarize data on nonrandom segregation in a wide variety of genetic systems. Despite apparent differences between some systems, the basic requirements for nonrandom segregation can be deduced from their shared characteristics: i) asymmetrical meiotic division(s); ii) functional asymmetry of the meiotic spindle poles; and iii) functional heterozygosity at a locus that mediates attachment of a chromosome to the spindle. The frequency with which all three of these requirements are fulfilled in natural populations is unknown, but our analyses indicate that nonrandom segregation occurs with sufficient frequency during female meiosis, and in exceptional cases of male meiosis, that it has important biological, clinical, and evolutionary consequences.},

	Abstract = {Speciation is often accompanied by changes in chromosomal number or form even though such changes significantly reduce the fertility of hybrid intermediates. We have addressed this evolutionary paradox by expanding the principle that nonrandom segregation of chromosomes takes place whenever human or mouse females are heterozygous carriers of Robertsonian translocations, a common form of chromosome rearrangement in mammals. Our analysis of 1170 mammalian karyotypes provides strong evidence that karyotypic evolution is driven by nonrandom segregation during female meiosis. The pertinent variable in this form of meiotic drive is the presence of differing numbers of centromeres on paired homologous chromosomes. This situation is encountered in all heterozygous carriers of Robertsonian translocations. Whenever paired chromosomes have different numbers of centromeres, the inherent asymmetry of female meiosis and the polarity of the meiotic spindle dictate that the partner with the greater number of centromeres will attach preferentially to the pole that is most efficient at capturing centromeres. This mechanism explains how chromosomal variants become fixed in populations, as well as why closely related species often appear to have evolved by directional adjustment of the karyotype toward or away from a particular chromosome form. If differences in the ability of particular DNA sequences or chromosomal regions to function as centromeres are also considered, nonrandom segregation is likely to affect karyotype evolution across a very broad phylogenetic range},

	Abstract = {Robertsonian translocations are the most common structural rearrangements of human chromosomes. Although segregation of Robertsonian chromosomes has been examined in many families, there is little consensus on whether inheritance in the balanced progeny conforms to Mendelian ratios. To address this question, we have compiled previously reported segregation data, by sex of parent, for 677 balanced offspring of Robertsonian carriers from 82 informative families and from a prenatal diagnosis study on the risk of unbalanced offspring in carriers of chromosome rearrangements. Care was taken to avoid any source of ascertainment bias. Our analysis supports the following conclusions: (1) the transmission ratio is not independent of the sex of the carrier; (2) the transmission ratio distortion is observed consistently only among the offspring of carrier females; (3) the transmission ratio distortion does not appear to be dependent on the presence of a specific acrocentric chromosome in the rearrangement. The sex-of-parent-specific origin of the non-Mendelian inheritance, the finding that the rearranged ("mutant") chromosomes are recovered at significantly higher frequency than the acrocentric ("normal") chromosomes, and the similarities between these observations and the segregation of analogous rearrangements through female meiosis in other vertebrates strongly support the hypothesis that the transmission ratio distortion in favor of Robertsonian translocations in the human results from the preferential segregation of chromosomes during the first meiotic division. This non-Mendelian inheritance will result in increased overall risk of aneuploidies in the families of Robertsonian translocation carriers, independently of the origin of the transmission ratio distortion.},

Several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon have been offered, ranging from strictly biological mechanisms related to the gametic differences between the sexes, to more evolutionary models based on sexually antagonistic selection. However, despite the long history of interest in heterochiasmy, empirical data has failed to support any theory or pattern consistently. Here I test two alternative evolutionary hypotheses regarding heterochiasmy across the eutherian mammals, and show that sexual dimorphism, but not sperm competition, is strongly correlated with recombination rate, suggesting that sexual antagonism is an important influence. However, the observed relationship between heterochiasmy and sexual dimorphism runs counter to theoretical predictions, with male recombination higher in species with high levels of sexual dimorphism. This may be the response to male-biased dispersal, which, rather than the static male fitness landscape envisioned in the models tested here, could radically shift optimal male fitness parameters among generations.},

@article{Zollner2004,
	Abstract = {It is a basic principle of genetics that each chromosome is transmitted from parent to offspring with a probability that is given by Mendels laws. However, several known biological processes lead to skewed transmission probabilities among surviving offspring and, therefore, to excess genetic sharing among relatives. Examples include in utero selection against deleterious mutations, meiotic drive, and maternal-fetal incompatibility. Although these processes affect our basic understanding of inheritance, little is known about their overall impact in humans or other mammals. In this study, we examined genome screen data from 148 nuclear families, collected without reference to phenotype, to look for departures from Mendelian transmission proportions. Using single-point and multipoint linkage analysis, we detected a modest but significant genomewide shift towards excess genetic sharing among siblings (average sharing of 50.43\% for the autosomes; P=.009). Our calculations indicate that many loci with skewed transmission are required to produce a genomewide shift of this magnitude. Since transmission distortion loci are subject to strong selection, this raises interesting questions about the evolutionary forces that keep them polymorphic. Finally, our results also have implications for mapping disease genes and for the genetics of fertility.},
