\section*{Introduction}
Despite the apparent unity of the organism, alleles can
gain an evolutionary advantage at a cost to  individual fitness
\citep{Burt2006}, often by exploiting meiosis and gametogenesis.
Because only one of the four products of female meiosis is transmitted to the egg, female meiosis is particularly vulnerable to such exploitation \citep{Sandler1957,Pardo-ManuelDeVillena2001a}. 
An allele that biases female meiosis in its favor (i.e. a meiotic driver), may increase in frequency even if this driver entails a pleiotropic fitness cost \citep{Prout1973}, generating a genetic conflict between the success of the driver and organismal fitness.
Meiotic drivers observed in both plants
\citep{Buckler1999,Fishman2005,Fishman2008}, and animals
\citep{Agulnik1990,Wu2005,Pardo-ManuelDeVillena2001c} highlight this
conflict -- the selfish benefits of drive and the associated
pleiotropic fitness costs sustain a balanced polymorphism
\citep{Prout1973}, 
and often generate ongoing evolutionary escalations of drive suppressors and enhancers \citep{Dawe1996,Fishman2008}. 
The threat of meiotic drive to organismal fitness is potentially so
severe that many basic properties of
meiosis and o\"{o}genesis, including the initial genome doubling in
meiosis I \citep{Haig1991}, arrested female meiosis
\citep{Mira1998}, centromere machinery \citep{Malik2002a,Malik2009,Malik2009}, and sex differences in the recombination rate \citep{Haig2010,Brandvain2012} 
have perhaps evolved to enforce fairness by disrupting meiotic drive \citep{Rice2013}.

It is therefore somewhat surprising that despite the intense evolutionary pressure on female meiosis to prevent meiotic drive, 
it is potentially open to sabotage by a virtual stranger -- a haploid sperm genome.
That is, in many animal species, female meiosis is completed only after fertilization \citep{Masui_book}, 
creating ample opportunity for interaction between the sperm and female meiotic machinery. 
Therefore, a `green-bearded' \citep{Gardner2010} sperm-acting allele that recognizes and facilitates the meiotic drive of a genetically equivalent allele in female meiosis %(a  heteromorphic dyad), 
     could presumably rapidly spread through a population. 
At first sight, female meiosis appears primed for exploitation by such selfish systems.  
Why then is the requirement of fertilization to complete female meiosis so ubiquitous? 

It is certainly not the case that animals are mechanistically incapable of circumventing this requirement.
The stage at which female meiosis requires fertilization varies widely across taxa, and in a few animals, 
	female meiosis is complete upon ovulation (that is, fertilization is not required for female meiosis \citep[see table 1 of ref 
][]{Masui_book}). 

It is also not the case that sperm is mechanistically incapable of influencing female meiosis.
In \emph{C. elegans}, premature deployment of the aster, a vital component of mitotic
machinery provided by the sperm, disrupts MII meiotic segregation
in the egg, leading to a triploid zygote \citep{McNally2012}. 
Thus, there is direct mechanistic evidence that sperm can influence female meiosis.
 Additionally, genetic evidence from the \emph{In} and \emph{Om}  drive systems in mice suggests that the 
 transmission of alternate alleles in heterozygous females can depend on sperm haplotype.  
 While ruling out the alternative hypothesis of early selection on zygotes \citep[pages
52-54][]{Burt2006} in these cases is challenging, it appears that the extent to which \emph{In} and \emph{Om} distort the second female meiotic division partially depends on the genotype of the fertilizing sperm \citep{Agulnik1993,Wu2005}.  
% Both of these female drive systems operate by distorting the second meiotic division, 
% and in both systems the outcome of female meiosis depends the genotype of the fertilizing sperm \citep{Agulnik1993,Wu2005}.  
%While such genetic evidence is suggestive, we note the difficulty in
%ruling out the alternative hypothesis of early selection on zygotes \citep[pages
%52-54][]{Burt2006}.


We develop population genetic models exploring the evolution of sperm influence on female meiotic drive, focussing on models in which `self-promoting' alleles in sperm facilitate drive of like genotypes during gametogenesis in heterozygous females.  
%In this article we explore through simple population genetic models the consequences of alleles that influence the outcome of female meiosis.
These models show that sperm modifiers of female meiotic drive are
unlikely to create a sustained conflict, and therefore 
female meiosis will have little incentive to evolve resistance to them.
In fact, the interests of sperm and egg  genomes' are often aligned, as both are invested in the fate of the resultant zygote (as was speculated for the \emph{In} locus \citep{Pomiankowski1993}).
Therefore, there is little selective benefit to females in preventing sperm to influence female meioses,
	indeed features of meiosis may evolve that facilitate the interaction of sperm with female meiosis.

itself.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% PLEIOTROPY MODEL [self-promoting]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the standard single-locus, biallelic model of female meiotic drive,
the driving allele is transmitted to the egg  in heterozygotes with
probability  $d > 1/2$, regardless of sperm genotype. To depict a case
of a self-promoting meiotic driver,  we modify this standard model such that the driver is only effective when fertilized by a sperm carrying that allele (see Figure
\ref{Eggsperm_2_allele_cartoon})
\footnote{the timing of fertilization relative to female meiosis places another constraint on $d$, for example, if fertilization (and therefore, sperm dependent drive) takes place at MII (as in mammals),
	female drive requires an uneven number of crossovers between the centromere and the drive locus, 
	so $d$ is bounded to be $<0.75$? \citep[see ][ for
        discussion]{Buckler1999}. }. %PUT THIS BACK IN
We then identify the conditions allowing the spread of this self-promoting driver, 
	and evaluate whether a driver of this form could generate a sustained conflict favoring the evolution of suppressors. 

For comparative purposes, we present the standard drive model in equations \ref{eqn.A1}-\ref{eqn.A3}, 
	and refer readers to the previous literature on this model \citep[e.g. ][]{Prout1973,Ubeda2004} for additional results. 
In this case, assuming the driving allele is deleterious in both sexes but fully recessive 
	(i.e. homozygous fitness equals $w_{BB}=1-s$ and other genotypic fitnesses equal $w_{AA}=w_{AB}=1$), 
	it always invades because,  when rare, it occurs predominantly in heterozygotes and therefore drives without a fitness cost. 
However, when $s$ is large ($s>(2d-1)/(2)$) a driver cannot fix, and
will be maintained as a protected polymorphism \citep{Prout1973}. The
        parameter space where the allele can invade but not fix is shown in white
        in Figure \ref{Invasion_space}A., and where it can fix in the green
        and orange areas \ref{Invasion_space}B. When the allele is
        maintained as a polymorphism, it provides an opportunity for the evolution of
	drive suppressors, corresponding well to empirical examples of
        female meiotic drive \citep[reviewed in ][]{Burt2006}. 

In contrast to a traditional driver, which drives but pays effectively
	no fitness cost when rare, 
	a self-promoting driver specifically creates homozygote
        zygotes when it drives. %in heterozygotes. 
%, and therefore there is a drive-associated fitness cost even when rare. 
It must therefore overcome a drive-associated homozygous fitness cost simply to spread when rare. 
The conditions allowing the invasion of a self-promoting driver
 	are consequently far more restrictive than those for a standard meiotic driver.
When rare, a fully recessive, self-promoting driver can only invade when $s$ 
	%, the selection against the drive homozygote, 
	is less than $(2 d - 1)/(4 d)$. 
This analytical approximation, derived from Equation \eqref{deltadriver} assuming Hardy-Weinberg, 
	closely matches results obtained by exact numerical iteration (Figure \ref{Invasion_space}). 


When a self-promoting driver does spread, 
	it spends much time at low frequency, 
	because the paucity of complimentary sperm compromises its ability to drive. 
However, once relatively common, it  rapidly achieves fixation due to its
	positive frequency dependent behavior (Inset in Figure \ref{Invasion_space}).  
This lack of a balanced polymorphism (Figure \ref{Invasion_space}) precludes the evolution of an
	allele that suppresses this form of meiotic drive in females.

%I SUBSTANTIALLY REWROTE THIS
The positive frequency dependence of a self-promoting driver can
induce bistability in its spread.
%OLD GRAHAM WORDS
 %, i.e. there is a critical frequency
%above which it can spread quickly to fixation and below which it moves towards loss (an
%unstable equilibrium frequency). In 
%the appendix, we develop a simple
%approximation to this bistability. 
When $s$ is too large to allow a rare driver to increase in frequency, but small enough to allow a common driver to fix (the inequality in EQUATION XXX),
there is  an unstable equilibrium frequency (approximated in EQUATION XXX)  
	above which it can spread quickly to fixation and below which it moves towards loss 
	(see Figure \ref{Bistab_homozyg_cost_fig} for exact results).	
%OLD GRAHAM WORDS
%This bistability occurs in the region of parameter space in Figure
%\ref{Invasion_space}. In Supplementary Figure
%\ref{Bistab_homozyg_cost_fig} we further explore this bistability and
%show that the unstable equilibrium frequency is high across much of
%this parameter space, and so in practice the self promoting allele
%only invade in the orange space. (In the appendix we develop a simple
%approximation to the unstable equilibrium frequency
%\eqref{bistab_homozy_approx} that is also shown in  Supplementary Figure
%\ref{Bistab_homozyg_cost_fig}).
This unstable equilibrium frequency is high across much of
	parameter space, likely too high to be reached by drift, 
	and therefore the more restrictive invasion criteria rather than the fixation criteria, will  likely determine the fate of self-promoting drivers. 


%OLD YANIV WORDS
% Compared to the invasion criteria, the parameter space
% allowing the fixation of the allele if it is above a cutoff frequency is much broader -- 
% 	a common, recessive, self-promoting driver fixes if
%         $s<(2d-1)/2$ approximately. 
% Therefore, when $(2 d - 1)/(4 d)<s<(2d-1)/(2)$, 
% 	a recessive, self-promoting driver will deterministically fix if drift, mutation, 
% 	or migration pressure bring its frequency above $(1-2d+4ds)/(2s(2d-1))$, 
% 	but it will be lost otherwise.
Inclusion of a heterozygous fitness cost (i.e. $w_{AB}=1-h_s$)
further constrains the evolution of a self-promoting driver. 
In fact, with any heterozygous fitness cost, a rare self-promoting
driver cannot spread deterministically. 
However, this case also displays bistability -- 
if $s < d - 1/2+s_h(3-2d)/2$ approximately, it will fix deterministically if its 
	frequency is greater than a threshold, $f_B^*$ [Equation \eqref{thresh2}, and \yb{FIGURES SXX}].
%	because it pays the  heterozygous fitness cost but drives
 %      ineffectively (see Figure S\ref{bistable_additive})
%While a standard female driver invades from low frequency when the transmission advantage outweighs the fitness cost (XXX),
%	a rare self-promoter pays a fitness cost, but drives only weakly because complementary sperm are uncommon. 
%This frequency-independent fitness cost, and positive frequency dependent drive generates a bistable system. 
%Below a cutoff frequency the self-promoter driver deterministically decreases in frequency 
%	because it pays the  heterozygous fitness cost but drives
 %      ineffectively (see Figure S\ref{bistable_additive}). 
%Above this frequency, the allele increases deterministically because the commonness of complementary sperm 
%	make drive effective enough to overcome the associated fitness cost.
This bistability prevents self-promoting drivers from invading 	
	reasonably sized populations, and assures that, if they do invade, they will rapidly fix.
Our model therefore predicts that self-promoting drivers will not be
observed as stable polymorphisms in natural populations. 

Although the allelic identity of sperm could plausibly influence the outcome of female meiosis, 
	limited gene expression in sperm \citep[e.g.][]{Joseph2004}
	suggest a model where sperm influence female meiosis via expression of the fertilizing male's
	diploid genotype (perhaps due to proteins and RNAs packaged into the sperm), rather than sperm haplotype.
This male-genotype dependent model requires one additional parameter, as we exchange $d$ in the sperm dependent case for $d_{het}$ and $d_{hom}$ which describe the transmission of the drive allele in a heterozygous female mating with males heterozygous and homozygous for the self-promoting drive allele, respectively.  
However, when
the distorting effect of genotype displays strong dominance in its
effect on female meiosis ($d_{het}$ is close to $d_{hom}$), 
there is a a narrow sliver of parameter space sustains a polymorphism
when the cost of the drive is recessive
(see Figure S\ref{Effect_of_dominance}, \yb{and Equations XXX in the Appendix}).  
Presumably this zone of polymorphism comes about because positive frequency dependence diminishes with the dominance of the male effect driver. 
%As an analytical example, consider the case of male-genotype dependent deleterious recessive female driver (assuming, as above, $w_{BB}=1-s$, and $w_{AA}=w_{AB}=1$). 
%Here, a rare driver invades when $s$ is less than $(d_{het}-1/2)/d_{het}$, and fixes when $s$ is less than $d_{hom} - 1/2$.
%Intermediate values of $s$, which represent a small proportion of parameter space can maintain a polymorphism. 
While mathematically interesting, it does not seem particularly realistic to think that the
effect of the drive allele would be dominant in its action through the
male genotype, while the cost would be recessive. 
Therefore, although this model can sustain a polymorphism, the lack of biological reality underlying the small portion of parameter values required for this polymorphism make us doubt it general applicability. 
%Thus we regard this case as interesting but not very general.


Given the difficulty that self-promoting meiotic drivers have entering the population, the speed at
which they fix if they do, and the narrow parameter range permitting balanced polymorphisms at such loci,  
it seems very unlikely that such alleles could drive the evolution of female suppressors of sperm-enabled
female meiotic drive.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% TWO LOCUS MODEL [modify (general) / facilitate (helps ) / prevent (stops)] 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Above, we explored a model were a driver that drove in females when signaled by a complementary allele in sperm.  
We complement this single locus model of an allele with pleiotropic effects in both sexes, 
 with  an alternative model of two linked loci - one female driver and the other a sperm allele which modifies the effect of drive upon fertilization. 
In this model, a female meiotic driver with no sperm-dependency, initially reaches drive-viability equilibrium (with two alleles
$A$ and $B$ are the ancestral non-driver and driver alleles).
Subsequently, a sperm-acting modifier of female meiotic drive arises tightly
        linked to this balanced locus (effectively creating a third
        allele/haplotype at this locus). Tight linkage offers the best
        chance for a collaboration to evolve between a driver and
       an enhancer of the drive, as recombination breaks up drive haplotypes \citep{Thomson1974,Charlesworth1978,Haig1991}. 
In addition tight linkage between female driver and sperm modifier is consistent with the nature of well characterized drive systems which are often maintained as polymorphic inversions with numerous linked modifiers (CITE).

%\yb{??In the SUPP we explore the dynamics of a sperm modifier of female drive unlinked to the female driver??} 

%%%sperm-acting facilitator
We first consider a sperm-acting facilitator of
	female meiotic drive tightly linked to the $B$ background, 
	generating a third allele $B^{+}$ (i.e. the non-recombining haplotype of a
        driver allele and sperm-acting drive modifier). 
This new allele acts in sperm to increase the effectiveness of both
	the $B$ and  $B^{+}$ drive in $AB$ and $AB^{+}$ heterozygotes, see Figure \ref{Eggsperm_3_allele_cartoon} 
	for a simple schematic of this drive model.  
Naively, the $B^{+}$ may spread by capitalizing on the additional drive it causes; however,  
	this is not the case for a few simple reasons. 
First, the sperm-acting drive facilitator (the novel $B^{+}$ haplotype) 
	arises when the ancestral driver ($B$) is at drive-selection balance, 
	and therefore immediately suffers a homozygous fitness cost.  
Worse yet, a novel $B^{+}$ haplotype most often helps 
	the $B$  allele drive ($B^+$ sperm meeting $AB$ eggs), because $B$ is initially more common than $B^{+}$. 
As $B^{+}$ facilitates $B$ these interactions frequently form 
	$BB^{+}$ heterozygotes that suffer the same fitness costs as $BB$. 
Therefore, sperm-acting drive facilitator alleles experience a profound disadvantage 
	in this scenario, even more so than under the previous two allele model. 
We have found no parameter range of this
	three allele system that allows the sperm-acting drive facilitator $B^{+}$ to
	invade the population. 

%%%sperm-acting drive suppressors
While  sperm enhancement of a female drive cannot displace a polymorphic female driver, sperm based drive suppression - that is sperm-acting alleles that act to restore  fairness of female meiosis can. 
If these sperm-acting drive suppressors arise on
	the non-driving $A$ background (creating a third allele $A^{-}$) ;
	or are unlinked to the drive locus they readily invade a population segregating
	for the drive system ($AB$, see Figure). 
This allele lowers the frequency of the original drive system (perhaps to zero),
	and spreads to fixation if it does not carry strong fitness costs
	(Figure \ref{Eggsperm_3_allele_cartoon} and \ref{Trajectories_of_supressors}A). 
This result is consistent with previous work showing that drive suppressors unlinked to, or in repulsion phase with drivers usually invade polymorphic drive systems \citep[e.g. ][]{Brandvain2012}.  

More surprisingly, sperm-acting suppressors of female drive can spread
	even when tightly linked to the original drive system (B), forming
	an novel third allele $B^{-}$ as above 
	(Figures \ref{Eggsperm_3_allele_cartoon} and \ref{Trajectories_of_supressors}B). 
$B^{-}$ displaces the original driver ($B$) by driving when not costly, 
	but by disrupting drive when transmitted to sperm it avoids low-fitness drive homozygotes ($BB^-$ and $B^-B^-$). 
Despite displacing the ancestral driver ($B$), self avoiding driver, $B^*$ it's equilibrium frequency is not always higher than that of $B$ \yb{(point to supp?)}.

%	 potential e.g. Do we mention the fact that the frequency of these
%	 newly invade sperm dodging alleles can be lower than the original system?}\\

\section*{Discussion}

Sexual reproduction is a high-stakes event that determines what gets transmitted to the next generation.  
As a consequence of this intense competition, alleles that gain a transmission advantage during reproduction 
	can succeed evolutionarily, even if they lower the 
        fitness of the population, 
	the mother whose offspring they will inhabit, 
	or the organism in which they reside. 
This generates numerous conflicts  \cite{Burt2006} including sexual conflicts between mates \cite{Arnqvist2005}, 
	and conflicts between alleles that are over-transmitted in meiosis and the organisms they injure while doing so. 
Such conflicts and their resolution likely play a major role in the structure and evolution of many basic biological processes \citep{Rice2013}.

It seems that allowing sperm to influence the outcome of female meiosis would generate a confluence of these potential conflicts -- 
	sperm could actually assist an allele that distorts female meiosis.
However, this is not the case.
We find that an allele which acts through sperm to distort female meiosis in its favor %YB [too awkward / unclear?] 
	can rarely spread through a population if it bears any cost. 
Additionally, when this self-promoting driver can spread, it can only rarely 
	be maintained as a protected polymorphism, and due to its positive frequency dependence 
	it spends very little time at intermediate frequency.
As such, this type of exploitation cannot generate a sustained genetic conflict.
It is therefore unlikely
	that female oogenesis and meiosis will evolve to prevent their effect.  
This likely explains why females can delay the completion of meiosis until after fertilization 
	without risking exploitation by collaborations by female
        drivers and sperm alleles.
%Male modification of recombination rates. \yb{trying to think through this \dots{}}

Why is it that an allele that biases female meiosis in its favor can generate a genetic conflict, but an allele in sperm that assists this female driver cannot? 
So long as the transmission advantage of female meiotic drive outweigh the organismal fitness cost to heterozygotes the female driver can spread when rare, and it increases in 		
	frequency until the fitness cost experienced when homozygous balances the transmission advantage.
By contrast a sperm promotor of female drive is only effective when matched with a heterozygote female -- meaning that when rare this allele rarely enhances female drive. 
Even worse, when it does so it will preferentially find itself in a low fitness drive homozygote. 
Not only are drive-promoting sperm alleles unable to create a sustained genetic conflict, 
	but alleles in sperm with the opposite effect - that is those that prevent their own drive through female meiosis do maintain a polymorphisms and 
	provide evolution  with time and opportunity to further minimize drive.
This is because such drive suppressing alleles reduced their chances
of forming low fitness homozygotes. 
In fact, an allele in sperm which causes the alternate allele to drive can be favored (FIG), a counterintuitive result 
	consistent with the tenuous evidence that the non-driving
        $ln^-$ allele is over transmitted through female meiosis in $ln^-/ln^+$ heterozygote when fertilized by $ln^+$
        sperm \cite{agulnick, Pomiankowski1993}.   
More generally, alleles that act through sperm to
 reduce the opportunity of female meiotic drive regardless of linkage or phase. 


%More generally both linked and unlinked alleles may often spread that act through sperm to
%reduce the opportunity of female meiotic drive in order to disable
%segregating drive systems, by for example reducing the mechanistic
%asymmetries that female drivers exploit. 





The interests of fertilizing sperm and female are quite well aligned during syngamy -- producing a viable and potentially fit offspring. 
%As noted above there are even opportunities for coevolution between sperm-based suppressors of female meiotic drive and the female genome.
Thus it seems plausible that aspects of oogenesis may actively evolve to facilitate the influence of sperm on ensuring a fair  outcome of female meiosis which generates fit offspring.
In light of that it is interesting to consider whether the phylogenetic variation in the stage of oogenesis when fertilization takes place reflects not
	only species' different reproductive ecologies, but also different selection pressures shaping the interaction of sperm alleles with female meioses.

%\yb{DOES THIS GO ANYWHERE? }

% Males can potentially influence the outcome of meiosis even before fertilization. 
% For example in Drosophila and other taxa, sperm accessory
%         gland proteins (ACPs) increase the female recombination rate
%         \cite{SOMEthING}, and there is some evidence that there is
%         variance across male genotypes in there effect on female
%         recombination rate \cite{Stevison2012}.
% Presumably this is a pleiotropic consequence of the resolution of double strand breaks initiated by the stressful/toxic composition of ACPs. 
% However, a pleiotropic effect of this is to increase the recombination rate which can decrease the effectiveness of female meiotic drivers
% active during MI \citep{Brandvain}. 
% We speculate that other effects of sperm on female meiosis may also be tolerated by females as a way of ensuring meiotic fairness -- 
% 	that is females evolve to allow male influence on female meiosis in cases in which the male influence is  egalitarian. 

%Gametogenesis and meiosis are common times for genetic conflict. 
%This is a consequence of the fact that as the set of alleles that consitute
%	an individual are in the process of parting ways, 
%	with only a subset of them being assured transmission.
%In constrast, the perspective of the fertilizing sperm's genome is different, it has to live with the consequences of any distortion it causes 
%to female meiosis through the entire next life cycle of the organism. 
%It is therefore in the interest of the fertilizing sperm's genome to
%make a high fitness zygote even if that means alleles in sperm
%disrupting other copies of themselves from gaining a 
%transmission advantage through female meiosis.

The sperm dependence of the drive is a form of assortative
transmission (mating), and so we have to keep track of the genotype frequencies.
Our genotype frequencies at birth are $x_{AA},~x_{AB},$ and
$x_{BB}$. These three genotypes have fitnesses $w_{AA},~w_{AB},$ and
$w_{BB}$, which are identical between males and females. Because 
fitnesses are equivalent in both sexes, genotypic frequencies
are identical in males and females, but in the following
equations they are marked with $\Mars$ and $\Venus$ respectively to
allow the reader to more easily follow the logic. 
The frequency of the three genotypes at birth in the next generation is:
\begin{equation}
x'_{BB} =\frac{1}{\bar{w} } \Big( w_{BB} x_{BB}^{\Venus} (w_{BB} x_{BB}^{\Mars} +\frac{1}{2}
  w_{AB} x_{AB}^{\Mars} ) + w_{AB} x_{AB}^{\Venus} (d w_{BB}
  x_{BB}^{\Mars} +\frac{1}{2} d
w_{AB} x_{AB}^{\Mars} ) \Big),  \label{eqn.A1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x'_{AA} =\frac{1}{\bar{w} } \Big(  w_{AA} x_{AA}^{\Venus} (w_{AA} x_{AA}^{\Mars} + \frac{1}{2}
   w_{AB} x_{AB}^{\Mars}) + w_{AB} x_{AB}^{\Venus}(\frac{1}{2} w_{AA} x_{AA}^{\Mars}+ \frac{1}{2} 
  w_{AB} x_{AB}^{\Mars}) \Big),  \label{eqn.A2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
x'_{AB} = & \frac{1}{\bar{w} } \Big( w_{AA} x_{AA}^{\Venus}  ( w_{BB}  x_{BB}^{\Mars} + \frac{1}{2}
  w_{AB}  x_{AB}^{\Mars} ) +w_{BB} x_{BB}^{\Venus} ( w_{AA}  x_{AA}^{\Mars} + \frac{1}{2}
  w_{AB}  x_{AB}^{\Mars} )  \nonumber \\
& + x_{AB}^{\Venus}(\frac{1}{2}  w_{AA}  x_{AA}^{\Mars}+\frac{1}{2} (1-d)
 w_{AB}  x_{AB}^{\Mars} + \frac{1}{4}  w_{AB}
 x_{AB}^{\Mars} + (1-d)  w_{BB}  x_{BB}^{\Mars} ) \Big) \label{eqn.A3}
\end{eqnarray}
where the mean fitness of the population is
\begin{equation}
\bar{w} = w_{AA} x_{AA}+w_{AB}  x_{AB} +w_{BB}  x_{BB}.
\end{equation}
We can then iterate this recursion over generations, for
example to produce the frequency trajectories shown in the inset
Figure \ref{Invasion_space} by plotting $x_{BB}+ \frac{1}{2}x_{AB}$
over time. We can also use this to assess the
invasion criteria for the allele by starting allele B at very low
frequency, and seeing if it increases across the generations.

\paragraph{Recessive fitness cost of self-promoting driver}
When the self-promoting driver has a recessive fitness cost, $s$ genotype frequencies after selection and drive equal
\begin{equation}	x'_{BB} =\frac{x_{B}^2(1-s)}{\bar{w} }  \Big( F+(1-F)(x_{B}+2x_{A} d) \Big) 	\end{equation}
\begin{equation}	x'_{AA} =\frac{1}{\bar{w} }  \Big(x_{A}^2\Big) 	\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}	x'_{AB} =\frac{2 x_{A}x_{B} }{\bar{w} }  \Big(1-x_{B}(d-1/2)(1-F) \Big)	\end{equation}

its change in frequency across generations $\Delta f_B$ is
\begin{equation}
\frac{f_A f_B^2}{\bar{w}} \left( [1-F][ d(1-2 f_A s) - f_B s-1/2] - s  F \right)
\label{deltadriver}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (HWE), and $f_A$ is the frequency of the non-driving allele. 
For analytical solutions presented above, we assume that $F$ equals zero. 

We used this HWE approximation to investifgate the bistability of the
invasion criteria. Under this approximation we find that a common, recessive, self-promoting driver fixes if
 $s<(2d-1)/2$. Furthermore, when $(2 d - 1)/(4 d)<s<(2d-1)/(2)$, a
 recessive, self-promoting driver will deterministically fix if drift,
 mutation, or migration pressure bring its frequency above approximately
\begin{equation} 
(1-2d+4ds)/(2s(2d-1)) \label{bistab_homozy_approx}
\end{equation}
 but it will be lost if it is introduced below this frequency
 (i.e. this is an unstable equilibrium point). In Supplementary Figure \ref{Bistab_homozyg_cost_fig} we show
 this approximation condition for bistability andd how it compared to
 that obtained using the recursion. This equation
 \eqref{bistab_homozy_approx} offers a reasonable, but imperfect
 approximation 
and seems to serve as a lower bound to the
true unstable equilibrium frequency. 

\paragraph{cost of driver in heterozygotes}
We explored a more complex model where the self-promoting driver has a cost, $s_h$ in heterozygotes (so $w_{AB} = 1-h_s$) in addition to the cost $s$, in homozygotes.
Model construction is similar to that above.
So long as there is any heterozygous fitness cost (i.e. $s_h > 0$) the self-promoting driver cannot invade when rare;
	however, as is the case without a heterozygous cost, this system is bistable.
Assuming no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg a self-promoting driver with a heterozygous fitness cost deterministically fixes if it's frequency exceeds some threshold, $f_B^*$.
\begin{equation}
	f_B^* = \frac{a_1+\sqrt{a_1^2+8 s_h a_2}}{2 a_2}
	\label{thresh2}
\end{equation}
where, $a_1=1-2 ds_h+4 d s-2 d-3 s_h$ and $a_2=2(s-s_h)(2d-1)$.
 
 range of other costs to the drive alleles other than a
simple recessive cost, for example an additive cost. We modified the recursions given in eqn
\ref{eqn.A1}-\ref{eqn.A3} to feature an additive cost $s$ for each
copy of the $B$ allele. A none recessive cost to the drive allele can
cause bistability of the drive allele. The B allele is unable to enter
the population when rare, this results from the fact that
when the allele is rare ($x_B \ll 1$) sperm carrying it rarely
encounter heterozygous eggs ($\sim x^2$) but the allele still pays a
cost in heterozygous individuals.  By contrast, when the B allele is common ($x_B
\gg 0$) encounters between heterozygous eggs and $B$ allele sperm
become more common allowing drive to occur this can allow the $B$
allele to spread when common. In Supplementary Figure
\ref{bistable_additive} we show the unstable equilibrium frequency
above which the $B$ allele can invade. This equilibrium frequency was found by a simple
parameter search.  \gc{wonder if a bit of work could find this}

\paragraph{Dominance} we also explored a model where
the genotype of the male who produced the fertilizing sperm affects female drive,
instead of just the allelic type of the sperm.
 We assume a heterozygous female will transmit the $B$ allele 
  with probabilities  $\frac{1}{2}$,  $\frac{1}{2} + h(d-\frac{1}{2}) $ or $d$, 
 if she mated with a n $AA$, $AB$, or $BB$ male,  respectively.
 Above, $d > 1/2$ and $h$ ($0 \geq h \geq 1$) acts to specify the dominance of the $B$
%allele's effect on female meiotic drive through the males genotype.
%YB TRY_1 We assume that in a mating between a heterozygous female and an $AA$, $AB$, or $BB$ male, the female will transmit the $B$ allele 
% with probabilities  $\frac{1}{2}$,  $\frac{1}{2} + h(d-\frac{1}{2}) $, and $d$, respectively.
  %Here $d > 1/2$ and $h$ ($0 \geq h \geq 1$) acts to specify the dominance of the $B$
%allele's effect on female meiotic drive through the males genotype.
% GC ORIGINAL  We assume that if a
%heterozygous egg ($AB$) is fertilized by a sperm with the following
%male ($\Mars$) genotypes the $B$ allele will be transmitted through
%female meiosis with the following probabilities \\
%\begin{tabular}{cccc}
%$\Mars$ geno. & AA & AB  & BB\\
%P(B). & $\frac{1}{2}$ &  $\frac{1}{2} + h(d-\frac{1}{2}) $ & $d$ 
%\end{tabular}\\
%where $d > 1/2$ and $h$ ($0 \geq h \geq 1$) acts to specify the dominance of the $B$
%allele's effect on female meiotic drive through the males genotype. 
We set up a set of recursions using a recessive sex independent cost to
the driver, similar to those in eqn.
\ref{eqn.A1}-\ref{eqn.A1}, but now featuring these male genotype
transmission probabilites. In Supplementary Figure \ref{Effect_of_dominance} we show the invasion
criteria for both the A and B alleles when they are rare. 
We find a narrow parameter range where B 
can invade but not fix.
This corresponds to B being less than fully recessive (i.e. $h>0$) and to a modest cost in homozygotes. 
This combination of parameters reflects the fact that when the allele is rare, 
it can increase in frequency due to fertilization of heterozygous eggs
by sperm from heterozygote males, where the sperm do not themselves
carry the allele. But as the B allele becomes common it will frequently be
present in the homozygous state in males, and so will be unable to
avoid the production of unfit homozygote zygotes leaving it trapped in
the population. 

\paragraph{three allele system}
%$x_{AA}$, $x_{AB}$,$x_{AB'}$, $w_{BB'} x_{BB'}$, $w_{B'B'} x_{BB}$, $w_{B'B'} x_{B'B'}$
We denote the frequency of the three genotypes in the population at birth are
$x_{AA}$, $x_{AB}$, $x_{AB'}$, $x_{BB'}$, $x_{BB}$, $x_{B'B'}$. 
The mean relative fitness of the population is 
\begin{equation}
x_{AA}+x_{AB}+ x_{AB'}+ w_{BB'} +x_{BB'}+w_{B'B'}x_{BB} + w_{B'B'} x_{B'B'} 
\end{equation}
The frequency of the genotypes in meiotic-cells of female adults is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\bar{w}}\Big( x_{AA}, ~x_{AB},~ x_{AB'},~ w_{BB'} x_{BB'},~ w_{B'B'}x_{BB},
~w_{B'B'} x_{B'B'} \Big)
\end{equation}
The frequency of fertilization events can be found by combining these
female frequencies with the frequency of the three alleles in sperm is
\begin{eqnarray}
x_A = & x_{AA} + \frac{1}{2} x_{AB}+ \frac{1}{2} x_{AB'} \\
x_B = & w_{BB}  x_{BB} +   w_{BB'} \frac{1}{2} x_{BB'}+ \frac{1}{2} x_{AB} \\
x_{B'} = & w_{B'B'}  x_{B'B'} +   w_{BB'} \frac{1}{2} + x_{BB'}+ \frac{1}{2} x_{AB'}  
\end{eqnarray}
in combination with the transmission probabilities given in Figure
\ref{Eggsperm_3_allele_cartoon}A.
